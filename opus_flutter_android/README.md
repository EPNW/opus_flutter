as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`. It will be automatically included in your app
when you depend on `package:opus_flutter`.

This is what the above means to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  opus_flutter: ^4.0.0
  ...
```

dependency:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  opus_flutter_android: ^4.0.0
  ...
```
